Introducing @ohochat/address - A Simplified Wrapper for Thailand Address Management
=====================================================================

Say goodbye to tedious address handling in Thailand! This lightweight package wraps around [thailand-geography-json](https://github.com/thailand-geography-data/thailand-geography-json) and empowers you to focus on building innovative features, rather than wrestling with data relationships and query filters.

With our package, you can effortlessly:

* Leverage pre-built relationships between address components
* Filter addresses by various criteria (e.g., province, district, etc.)
* Build robust address-based applications without worrying about the underlying complexity

By using @ohochat/address, you'll enjoy a more streamlined development experience and deliver high-quality results faster.
